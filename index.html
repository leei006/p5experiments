    <a class="example" href="Ex1.html">Example 1 – Moving Circle</a>
    <br>
    <p>Using a simple 2D circle I added a pink fill and yellow stroke to differentiate the shape from the background. I added a motion feature which allows the circle to move from left to right and bounce back off the page.</p>
    <br>
    <a class="example" href="Ex2.html">Example 2 – Spinning Torus</a>
    <br>
    <p>I wanted to experiment with the different shape options I found in the ps5 website menu. Torus was one I have never heard before. I thought it would be interesting to layer two shapes and have them rotating in a helix fashion. Using two tori I was able to manipulate the speed they circle one another to create the effect I wanted.</p>
    <br>
    <a class="example" href="Ex3.html">Example 3 – Floating Particles
    </a>
    <br>
    <p>For the last example I built off of the moving particles example from class. I changed the colors to fit the pink theme I had for my previous two examples. I wanted to use the example template so that I could have an easier time understanding how certain code effects the speed/placement of the elements. I ended up having my particles move off the page the longer you watch them float.</p>
